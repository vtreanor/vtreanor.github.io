# Yes, its raining again.
As if the country wasn't soggy enough. We are in for another day of rain. 
It seems to have been raining overnight as well. As Summers go, 
this one will definitely win no medals.  
I had hoped to do all kinds of things this year but it is looking less and 
less likely that I will get to them.

So, it is time to think up some alternatives. If it's raining then it seems logical to
- either do some stuff indoors or
- do outdoor stuff that is not affected by the rain.
- abandon all and go back to bed. Just need a nice blonde.
